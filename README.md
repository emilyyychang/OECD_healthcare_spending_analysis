# Healthcare Spending: OECD Analysis
This project explores whether increased healthcare expenditure per capita is positively correlated with lower preventable deaths, shorter hospital stays, greater access to medical technology, and higher life expectancies at birth across OECD countries from 2000 to 2019. My hypothesis was that greater healthcare spending would be positively correlated with the chosen categories across countries. 

To test this hypothesis, I compiled and standardized multiple datasets from the OECD, ensuring consistency across countries and years by tidying data through a custom preprocessing function. Key steps included cleaning column names, filtering for relevant variables, converting data to numeric formats, and restricting the analysis to the years 2000–2019 to avoid confounding effects from the COVID-19 pandemic. To analyze the relationship between healthcare expenditure and healthcare quality, I developed a ranking system for each considered variable—preventable deaths, hospital stay lengths, medical technology access, and life expectancy—assigning lower ranks to better performance (e.g., a rank of 1 for the best). The function calculated the mean and standard deviation for each variable to determine appropriate weights for a weighted average. I then aggregated these rankings into a composite score for each country, reflecting overall healthcare quality. After cleaning and finalizing the rankings, I examined the correlation between a country's healthcare quality ranking and its healthcare expenditure rankings, both as a percentage of GDP and per capita.  

Despite prior research indicating a positive correlation between expenditure and healthcare quality, my findings did not support the hypothesis. Statistical analysis revealed no significant relationship between healthcare expenditure, whether measured as a percentage of GDP or per capita, and the metrics of healthcare quality defined in this study. This includes preventable deaths, average hospital stay lengths, access to medical technology, and life expectancies. In line with previous studies the results suggest that while financial resources are necessary for a functioning healthcare system, healthcare expeniditure alone is not a reliable predictor of healthcare quality.
